kj-build
--------

The purpose of this repo is to add some opinionated development tools that I use to develop KJ, without cluttering up the KJ source repo for thos who just want to build it or refer to its Haskell source.

This may later also serve as a reference for setting up what I believe to be a light but powerful and productive Haskell development environment using nix, ghcid and some build scripts.
